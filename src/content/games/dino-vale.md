**Dino Vale** is a retro-style real-time strategy (RTS) game where your main objective is to wipe out all enemies: manage berries, build castle, house and towers, and hunt wild animals for survival and experience points. Think fast, position your troops, and destroy enemy fortresses in classic RTS style.

### Key Features

- **RTS Command & Resource Management:**  
  Collect berries to construct new buildings and house a growing army of units.
- **Animal and Enemy Variety:**  
  Wild dinosaurs like Baryonyx and Carnotaurus roam the map. Enemies include Thieves (melee), Shamans (ranged), Lancers (extended reach), and the mighty Troll boss.
- **Unit Progression:**  
  Units and heroes gain experience from defeating enemies and hunting animals, allowing for improved stats.
- **Dynamic AI and Map Events:**  
  Enemy units and animals have unique AI behaviors, making every round different.
- **Multiple Maps & Modes:**  
  Play across four unique maps with different starting conditions and strategies.
- **No Paywall:**  
  100% free to play and accessible for all RTS fans.

### How to Play

- **Select and Command:**  
  Tap to select your units. Assign them to move, gather resources, attack, or build.
- **Build and Defend:**  
  Use resources to house more units and improve your defense.
- **Hunt and Survive:**  
  Track and hunt wild animals for resources and experience, but beware—some prey become predators!

### Passive Animals

- **Sheep:** It gives almost no xp and food, only for a little starting boost.
- **Sheep Grass:** Has double the xp of regular Sheep... Still it doesnt mean a lot!
- **Oviraptor** Little dinossaur, regular XP, regular health
- **Styracosaurus** Even though this dinossar doesnt attack, it has a lot higher health than Baryonyx. It may take some time killing it...

### Ferocious Animals

- **Baryonyx:** Fast, aggressive dino—very dangerous to unprotected units!
- **Carnotaurus:** Powerful dino—needs a strong unit to hunt.

### Enemies

- **Enemy Worker:** Just like your worker, it doesnt attack, but by killing it you may decrease the enemy resource gathering capabilities!
- **Thief:** Basic enemy; melee stats match your early warriors.
- **Shaman:** Ranged nemesis, equivalent to your archers but with spell power.
- **Lancer:** Extended weapon reach, matches your spearman in power.
- **Troll:** Very dangerous enemy; has stats comparable to your Panda unit.


### **Progression**

Gain experience by fighting and hunting, allowing your units to level up and overcome even the toughest battles.

### **Why Play Dino Vale?**

- For strategy and RTS enthusiasts seeking dinosaur-themed, retro-inspired gameplay.
- For players wanting deep, tactical, unit, and resource management on mobile.
- For anyone who wants classic RTS back.
